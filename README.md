Gameplay Mechanics:
Upon launching the game, players are greeted with a sleek and user-friendly interface. The game board consists of four colorful and illuminated buttons, each representing a unique musical note: red, blue, green, and yellow.

2. **Sequence Generation:** The game starts by playing a short sequence of button presses, lighting up the corresponding buttons and emitting musical tones. Each successful round, the sequence grows progressively longer.

4. **Feedback and Progress:** The game provides immediate feedback after each round. If the player reproduces the sequence accurately, they're rewarded with a cheerful sound, and the game advances to the next round. Incorrect button presses trigger a buzzer sound, and the game ends.

5. **High Scores:** The game keeps track of the player's highest score for each difficulty level, motivating players to improve their memory and pattern recognition skills.

6. **Sound and Visual Effects:** Simon Game features captivating audio and visual effects.
